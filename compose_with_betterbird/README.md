# Compose with Betterbird

This service menu is a derived work of the *Compose With Thunderbird* service menus,
and provides the same features, but works with the Betterbird email client, which is
a Thunderbird fork.

to compose an email with the Betterbird client and allows to:
- compose a new email attaching all the selected files in the folder;
- store the selected files in a cache file;
- compose a new email attaching all the cached files;
- compose a new email attaching the selected file together with the cached file;
- clean up the cache file.
